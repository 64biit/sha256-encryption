# SHA256 Python Encryption

SHA256 is Encryption Algorithm for encrypting certain values. It was created by [The National Security Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) and this is my implementation for the  [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install.

```bash
pip install sha256
```

## Usage

```python
import sha256

# encrypt a value
value = encrypt("helloworld")

print(value)
```

Output:
